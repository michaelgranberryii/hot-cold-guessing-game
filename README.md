# Hot-Cold Guessing Game

The hot-cold number guessing game is a guessing game played between a machine and a human player. The machine will generate a random number and save it in a signal called secret_number. The user tries to guess the number. The machine will give hints whether their guess is "hot" (greater than the secret number) or "cold" (smaller than the secret number).
